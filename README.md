# Counter_App
This is a Simple Counter App is a beginner-friendly web application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to increment or decrement a number using simple + and − buttons. It’s a great project for understanding the basics of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

The user interface is designed using Tailwind CSS, offering a clean, modern, and responsive layout. The central focus of the app is a number display with two buttons—one to increase and one to decrease the count. Each button press instantly updates the displayed number.
